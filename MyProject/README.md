What is my game?

My game takes a unique approach to the souls-like genre, doing away with the conventional third-person viewpoint in favor of a rune-scape-like one. 
I made an effort to design an environment that would both have its own personality and align with the ethics of both games. 
We use the traditional Runescape camera when exploring, but when engaged in combat, we switch to the more traditional Dark Souls gameplay.
